# CSCI 395 Verilog'ing

This is a dump of a bunch of code I wrote while taking CSCI 395 at Reed College.
This code exists only for the purposes of my learning.

There's also a cache with CLOCK eviction :\)

TODOs:
+ [ ] Arbitrarily large caches
+ [ ] Paramaterize line, address sizes
+ [ ] Concurrent reading/writing
